## 📖 About

**Shukabase AI** is a cutting-edge desktop application designed to bridge the gap between ancient wisdom and modern technology. It serves as your personal research assistant for studying the Bhaktivedanta Vedabase (Bhagavad-gita, Srimad-Bhagavatam, Caitanya-caritamrta, and more).

Powered by **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** technology, Shukabase allows you to ask complex questions in natural language and receive accurate, citation-backed answers directly from the scriptures.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🧠 Smart Semantic Search**: Go beyond keywords. Ask "What is the duty of a soul?" and get relevant verses across all books.
- **🦜 Interactive AI Assistant**: Chat with *Shuka*, your spiritual guide powered by **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** (Free) or connect your own **OpenRouter** models.
- **📚 Rich Library Support**:
  - *Bhagavad-gita As It Is*
  - *Srimad-Bhagavatam*
  - *Sri Caitanya-caritamrta*
  - *Nectar of Devotion* & more.
- **🌍 Multilingual**: Full support for **English** and **Russian** languages (Interface + Content).
- **⚡ Performance First**: Built with **Rust** and **Tauri** for a lightweight, blazing-fast experience.
- **🔄 Auto-Updates**: The app keeps itself up-to-date automatically.
